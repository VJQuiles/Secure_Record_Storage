# Secure_Record_Storage

Welcome to secure record storage, where you can write notes to help keep you on track, and make sure you as the user are the only one that can see them. Here you will find the concepts of authorization and authentication applied. 

## How to run

For this project, I recommend the use of Postman to test the routes. 

You will find a file with sample data, that I used to easily test the routes, and you can use as well. For the role in User, make sure to pick 'admin' or 'user' when creating the user. 

When sending requests to access the notes, ensure that you are sending the token in authorization tab with the type Bearer token. 

## Reflection

Honestly, I think the biggest benefit from this project, was learning to work with code written by someone else. I saw it as good practice for what we could be doing on the job, and it challeneged e to find the flow of what they were doing. It also made me reflect on how I would have done things(very differently). But nonetheless, it was also good in terms of testing what we learned up to this point, and testing if you really know where certain things go. 

To be honest, I had the most trouble locating some errors with the code(wasn't a lot). Aside from that, I had to try a couple times to send the right information to properly test the routes. 

## Resources

I used an updated version of the Baic_Login repo, that also had adminOnly applied in it. We didn't do as much in that lab, but enough with the examples given in class to understand the logical flow of how authentication and authorization are handled. I also refernced some of the code examples in lesson 3.
